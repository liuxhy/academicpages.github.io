I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) working with [Prof. Kevin Grise](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/kevin-grise/).

Prior to joining UVa, I obtained my bachelor degree from the College of Atmospheric Sciences at Lanzhou University and spent my third year in Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, where I worked closely with [Prof. Keith Shine](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/keith-shine/).

Research Interest
------
I have a broad interest in our Earth's climate system, especially the large-scale atmospheric circulation and clouds. My current research mainly focuses on understanding possible mechanisms controlling variabilities of the large-scale atmospheric circulation (particularly jet streams) both in current climate and under greenhouse gas forcing and examining how these processes are represented in climate models. I'm also interested in the application of machine learning in climate science.
