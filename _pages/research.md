Processes associated with interannual variabilities of the regional jet streams
======
The interannual movement and intensification of the subtropical jet (STJ) and polar front jet (PFJ) streams have important implications for global and regional climate.  Previous studies have related the position and strength of the STJ to tropical thermodynamic processes, whereas the position and strength of the PFJ are more associated with mid-latitude eddies. These conclusions have largely resulted from studies using idealized models.  In this study, ERA-Interim reanalysis and CMIP6 global climate models are used to examine the mechanisms responsible for controlling the interannual variability of the STJ and PFJ at different longitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during winter. Consistent with idealized modeling studies, a close relationship is found between tropical outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and the STJ, and between mid-latitude surface temperature gradients and the PFJ.  The movement and intensification of the NH PFJ reflect variations in surface baroclinicity. Variations in tropical convection over the Pacific Ocean are linked to variations in the strength and position of the NH STJ at almost all longitudes, with different phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) associated with the poleward shift and strengthening of the STJ in different regions.  CMIP6 models generally capture these relationships, but the models’ tropical convection is often displaced westward when compared to observations, reflecting a climatological bias in OLR in the western tropical Pacific Ocean in many models.  The displaced tropical convection in models excites different paths of Rossby wave propagation, resulting in different ENSO teleconnections on the STJ over North America and Europe.
